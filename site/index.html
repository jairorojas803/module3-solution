                Chicken meat is what the muscle tissues and organs of chicken are called. It is very common to find it in many dishes and culinary preparations around the world. Its meat is considered a staple food and it is for this reason that it is included in the consumer price index. The origin of the relationship of this species with humans dates back to the Neolithic, and specifically within the framework of the change from hunter-gatherer societies to farmers-livestock. Some studies reveal that the first domesticated hens and chickens may have come from India, more than 4,000 years ago.

His presence in the life of man is not new. The first remains date from the Neolithic, from the year 6000 a. They were found in the Chinese province of Hebei and from there they passed to Europe at the hands of the Sumerians. In the Egypt of Tuthmosis III (1500 BC) there is already evidence of poultry farmers, and in the gastronomic treatises of Rome in the 1st century AD. C.

Advances in science, as well as new hygienic-sanitary knowledge, allowed the spread of chicken consumption to the entire population during the 20th century ”. Its prodigious decade arrived in 1960. It stopped being a luxury item to become a regular product in diets due to its high protein and vitamin content and the very low presence of fat.It is usually used in a wide variety of preparations ranging from grilled (barbecue), oven roasted, fried, battered fried, stewed or in the preparation of soups and broths.

You can see its minced meat turned into cold cuts, hamburgers and other elaborated products (mainly the cut called breast, since by itself it has little flavor and very low fat content).

Some of its components are associated with the preparation of fast food and some chains such as Kentucky Fried Chicken have specialized in serving portions of this meat on their plates.La carne de pollo es una de las más saludables del mercado.
